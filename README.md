### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Here you can find some of my personal projects I'm working on. 

I love programming contests so I usually save my solutions to problems of the exams I like, so you can also read them if you want to learn some techniques :smiley:

I love to work in Python and Javascript, so if you consider I could help in any project, send me a message, I would love to work in something that can help the community :clap:
