### Hello there 👋

I'm Antonio. I love coding in Python, Dart and Javascript, so if you consider I could help in any project, send me a message, I would love to help in open source projects! :octocat:

Right now I'm working on tiny projects because of my lack of time, but you will find those tiny things in the repository [tiny_projects](https://github.com/iam-agf/tiny_projects).
